\section{Patterns of morphological diversity}
Thesis introduction
Patterns of diversity, morphological differences, geometric morphometrics overview

\section{Disparity}
Exceptional diversity
Adaptive radiations and morphological disparity

\section{Convergence}
Long history of study
Repeatability of evolution
Methods of measuring convergence
%Or maybe put this section into the discussion instead?

\section{Tenrecs}
Phylogenetic history, phenotypic and ecological variety
Commonly considered to be both an adaptive radiation and convergent group but this hasn't been tested

\section{Structure \& contents of this thesis}
Brief introduction of each section
